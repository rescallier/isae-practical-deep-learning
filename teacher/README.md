## About

The idea of this course is based on the [excellent tutorial given by Martin Gorner](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/tensorflow-without-a-phd/tree/master/tensorflow-planespotting)

Khumeia was designed in 2018 to be an end-to-end framework for data processing. However, pedagogical considerations led it to be scrapped in 2019 and later, only to be used as dataset generation helper to generate the students' datasets.
