# Deep Learning for Computer Vision, practical session at ISAE-SUPAERO

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation of a "Deep Learning practical session" given at ISAE-SUPAERO on December 2nd/3rd 2019

The introduction slides can be accessed at [this URL website](https://fchouteau.github.io/isae-practical-deep-learning). It is recommended to read it first as it contains the necessary information to run this from scratch.

You can find a rough guideline and usage references in the jupyter notebooks in `jupyter/`

## Where to run it ?

This hands on session is based on running code & training using [Google Cloud Platform Deep Learning VMs](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm/), see `gcp/` for examples on configuring your own machine. However, this is theoretically runnable everywhere since even data access in managed by the included python package.

Should you want to do this at home you can use Google Collaboratory instances: https://colab.research.google.com/

## Usage & Contribution
